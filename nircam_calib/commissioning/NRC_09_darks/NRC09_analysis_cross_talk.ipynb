    "Characterize the properties of the cross-talk using the methods described in Rest 2015 (JWST-STScI-004361): In theory, when reading out our NIRCam detectors with 4 different amplifiers, we may see some electronic cross-talk. In general, a fraction of the signal of a pixel read out in the “offender” amplifier a gets added to the signal of the pixel in the “victim” amplifier that is read out at the same time. In most detectors, cross-talk between amplifiers is less than 1%. It can be seen more easily in images with bright sources, like saturated stars. Previous analysis of NIRCam ground data has not shown obvious cross-talk in NIRCam images, suggesting that the effect is well below the percent level. However, NIRISS detectors show cross-talk values on the order\n",
    "of 0.6%. Even though the cross-talk occasionally shows a small spatial and/or signal dependence, in most cases a single constant suffices to characterize the effect. We can determine the cross-talk using pixels that have a significantly higher count than the average, such as cosmic rays and hot pixels. Investigate this affect to determine cross-talk constants and compare with ground data. "
