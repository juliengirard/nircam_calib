backPreScreen: True ## Pre-screen the background for outliers before trying to fit?
apWidth: 4. ## Source aperture width
dispPixels: [312, 2010] ## pixels to use in the dispersion direction
jdRef: 2457551 ## JD reference offset to subtract for plotting
timingMethod: JWSTint ## how to assign integration times? None, 'JWSTint' will add int time to exposure start
